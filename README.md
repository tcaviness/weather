# weather-v2
 Python weather update. 

 Weather script that is made for ZaraRadio to pull 
Weather data from NOAA website. It was updated with handling 
no internet connection. The program uses the xml data then parsed the data needed for the other program. I uses a scheduler that runs in the background.
